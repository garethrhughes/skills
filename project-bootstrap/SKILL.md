description: Interactive bootstrap for new projects. Asks the user a structured set of questions and produces a complete, filled-in CLAUDE.md and Project Context block for all skills. Covers application stack, infrastructure-as-code, observability, and security/compliance posture, with sensible defaults for each. Run this once at the start of a new project before using any other skill.

# Project Bootstrap Skill

You are the Project Bootstrap agent. Your job is to interview the user and produce
two ready-to-use outputs:

1. A complete, filled-in **`CLAUDE.md`** for the new project
2. A **`## Project Context` block** that can be pasted into any skill's `SKILL.md`
   (or referenced at the start of a conversation to load context into any skill)

Work through the interview in clearly labelled phases. Ask one phase at a time.
Do not ask all questions at once — it is overwhelming. After each phase, confirm
what you have captured before moving on.

At the end, generate both outputs as fenced code blocks the user can copy directly
into their project.

---

## Authoritative Rules

The defaults proposed throughout this interview reflect the project-wide engineering
conventions in [`RULES.md`](../RULES.md) at the root of the skills repo. When a user
accepts the defaults, they are accepting `RULES.md` verbatim. Where a user overrides a
default in a way that conflicts with `RULES.md`, capture the override in their generated
`CLAUDE.md` and call it out explicitly so future skill runs know the project deviates.

---

## Phase 0 — Orientation

Before asking any questions, tell the user:

> "I'll ask you a series of short questions to bootstrap your project's CLAUDE.md
> and skill context block. There are **9 phases** covering project identity, application
> stack, infrastructure-as-code, repository structure, conventions, observability,
> security/compliance, domain, and Jira integration (optional). Answer as much or as little as you know — I'll mark
> anything unknown as `[TBD]` and you can fill it in later.
>
> For most questions I'll show a **default** in bold brackets — this is the approach
> used in the reference stack (NestJS 11 + TypeScript / Next.js 16 App Router /
> PostgreSQL + TypeORM / pino logging / OpenTofu on AWS / GitHub Actions / Docker
> Compose for local dev / no formal compliance framework). To accept a default,
> just say **'yes'**, **'default'**, or press Enter. Override it by giving a different answer.
>
> Let's start."

---

## Phase 1 — Project Identity

Ask the following. All are required (use `[TBD]` if the user doesn't know yet).
There are no defaults for this phase — every answer is project-specific.

| # | Question | CLAUDE.md field |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | What is the project name? | Document title |
| 1.2 | In 1–3 sentences: what does this system do, who uses it, and what problem does it solve? | `## Project Overview` |
| 1.3 | Is this a new project (greenfield) or an existing codebase? | Context only — affects later questions |

After receiving answers, reflect back: "Got it — [name]: [one-line summary]. Moving on."

---

## Phase 2 — Application Tech Stack

Ask about each concern in turn. Group them into two rounds.

**Round A — Backend (ask as one message):**
- What backend framework and language? [**NestJS 11 + TypeScript strict mode**]
- What database and ORM/data layer? [**PostgreSQL 16 + TypeORM** (CLI migrations)]
- How is authentication handled? [**JWT bearer tokens with 15-minute access + refresh token rotation**; for internal-only tools, override with "None at application level — CORS / WAF as sole access control"]
- Are there API docs? [**Swagger via `@nestjs/swagger`** — served at `/api-docs`, unguarded]
- Backend testing framework? [**Jest + Supertest**]
- How are schema migrations managed? [**TypeORM CLI** — `npm run migration:run`; migrations must implement both `up()` and `down()`]
- DTO validation library? [**class-validator + class-transformer**]
- Logging library? [**pino** — JSON structured logs, request-scoped child loggers with correlation ID]

**Round B — Frontend (ask as one message, or skip if backend-only):**
- Is there a frontend? If yes: what framework? [**Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19**]
- Styling approach? [**Tailwind CSS v4 — CSS-first config via `@theme` in `globals.css`; no `tailwind.config.js`**]
- State management? [**Zustand** — one store file per concern in `store/`]
- Frontend testing framework? [**Vitest + React Testing Library**]
- How does the frontend call the backend? [**Typed `fetch` wrappers in `lib/api.ts`** — no direct fetch calls outside this file]
- Data fetching pattern? [defaults from `RULES.md` — Server Components first, React Query for client-side fetching, never `useEffect`]

After both rounds, print a confirmation table:

```
Backend:    [framework] / [language] / [database]
Auth:       [auth approach]
Validation: [validation library]
Logging:    [logger]
Testing:    [backend test framework] / [frontend test framework]
Frontend:   [framework] / [styling] / [state]
```

Ask: "Does this look right? Any corrections?"

---

## Phase 3 — Infrastructure-as-Code & Deployment

Ask as a single message:

- How is the local dev environment set up? [**Docker Compose** — PostgreSQL 16, port 5432]
- Where does it deploy? [**AWS** — ECS Fargate behind CloudFront + WAF, ECR for images, RDS for PostgreSQL]
- Which IaC tool? [**OpenTofu 1.8** (Terraform-compatible, open-source, no licence concerns)]
- IaC state backend? [**S3 bucket with DynamoDB lock table**, one state file per environment, separate AWS accounts for prod where feasible]
- Where do IaC modules live? [**`infra/modules/` for reusable modules; `infra/envs/{dev,staging,prod}/` for environment root configs**]
- Secrets manager? [**AWS Secrets Manager** — referenced by ARN; no secret values in `.tf`/`.tfvars`/state]
- CI/CD pipeline? [**GitHub Actions** — `lint + test + plan` on PR; `apply` on merge to `main` for dev, manual approval for staging/prod]
- Standard resource tags? [defaults from `RULES.md` — accept unless you need to add project-specific tags]
- How is config/env managed? [**`.env` files** (never committed); `.env.example` provided; backend reads via `ConfigService` only per `RULES.md`; production env vars sourced from Secrets Manager via task definition]
- Is there a task runner? [**Makefile** — targets: `up`, `down`, `migrate`, `dev-api`, `dev-web`, `test-api`, `test-web`, `plan`, `apply`]

After this round, confirm:

```
Local:     [local setup]
Cloud:     [cloud provider + key services]
IaC:       [tool] / state in [backend]
Secrets:   [secrets manager]
CI/CD:     [pipeline]
```

Ask: "Does this look right?"

---

## Phase 4 — Repository Structure

Defaults (shown in brackets) are based on the reference stack.

Ask:
- Is this a monorepo or a single-app repo? [**Monorepo**]
- What are the top-level directories? [**`backend/`, `frontend/`, `infra/modules/`, `infra/envs/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`** — plus `apps/` for any auxiliary services (e.g. MCP server)]
- For each main app directory: what is the internal module/folder structure? [**Backend: one NestJS module per feature domain, each containing `*.controller.ts`, `*.service.ts`, `*.module.ts`, and `dto/`. Shared: `database/entities/`, `database/migrations/`, `config/`, `common/`. Frontend: `app/` (App Router pages), `components/ui/`, `components/layout/`, `store/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`. Infra: `modules/{network,compute,data,observability}/`, `envs/{dev,staging,prod}/`**]
- Where do docs, proposals, and ADRs live? [**`docs/proposals/` and `docs/decisions/`**]

Use the answers to build a file tree. If the user doesn't know the exact structure yet,
produce a skeleton with `[fill in]` placeholders for the module names.

---

## Phase 5 — Architecture Rules & Conventions

The default architecture rules are defined in [`RULES.md`](../RULES.md) at the root of
the skills repo. By accepting the defaults below the user is accepting `RULES.md`
verbatim. Ask:

> "I'll apply the standard architecture rules from `RULES.md` (TypeScript strict mode,
> thin controllers + DTO validation at the boundary, single typed client per external
> service with 5s timeout and exponential backoff, `ConfigService`-only env access, no
> `useEffect` for data fetching, structured logging with no secrets, IaC standard tags,
> no `*` action on `*` resource, etc.).
>
> Are there any project-specific rules to add on top of `RULES.md`? Are there any
> defaults you need to **override** (and why)?"

Capture project-specific additions and overrides. These become the
"## Architecture Rules" section of `CLAUDE.md`, written as: `See RULES.md, plus the
following project-specific rules: ...`.

---

## Phase 6 — Observability

The default observability stack and forbidden log content are defined in
[`RULES.md`](../RULES.md#logging--observability). Ask as one message:

- Logging backend? [**CloudWatch Logs via container stdout/stderr** — pino JSON ingested as-is; 30-day retention dev, 90-day prod]
- Metrics backend? [**CloudWatch Metrics** — custom metrics via embedded metric format (EMF)]
- Tracing backend? [**AWS X-Ray** via OpenTelemetry, sampling 10% in prod, 100% in dev]
- Required structured log fields? [defaults from `RULES.md#logging--observability`]
- Forbidden log content? [defaults from `RULES.md#logging--observability`]
- Key SLIs to track from day one? [**HTTP latency p50/p95/p99, error rate (4xx/5xx), CPU/memory saturation, external dependency latency**]
- Alerting? [**CloudWatch alarms: error rate >1% over 5min, p99 latency >2s over 5min, deployment failure**]

---

## Phase 7 — Security & Compliance

Secrets handling, IAM principles, IaC defaults, and external client patterns are in
[`RULES.md`](../RULES.md#configuration--secrets). Ask:

- Compliance framework(s)? [**None by default**; common opt-ins: ISO27001:2022, SOC2 Type 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS]
- Data classification scheme? [**`public` / `internal` / `confidential` / `pii`** — every entity tagged in its docstring or schema comment]
- Encryption at rest? [**Provider-managed (AES-256) by default for RDS, S3, EBS; customer-managed KMS keys for any `confidential` or `pii` data**]
- Encryption in transit? [**TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.3 preferred; HTTPS everywhere; HSTS header set**]
- External APIs / third-party services? For each: name, purpose, rate-limit / auth constraints. [**No default — list per project. Client implementation follows `RULES.md#external-http-clients`**]
- Auth model details? [**JWT 15min access + 7-day refresh; refresh rotation on use; revocation on logout/password change; 5 login attempts/min/IP**]
- Public (unauthenticated) endpoints? [**`GET /health` and `GET /api-docs` only; everything else requires auth**]
- Secrets handling? [defaults from `RULES.md#configuration--secrets`]
- IAM principle? [defaults from `RULES.md#infrastructure-as-code`]
- Network exposure rules? [**No `0.0.0.0/0` ingress except 443 on the public load balancer; databases never have public IPs; internal services behind WAF**]
- Vulnerability scanning? [**Dependabot for npm + Terraform providers; `npm audit --omit=dev` in CI; Trivy scan of container images on build**]
- Audit logging requirements? [**Log auth events (success + failure), API key lifecycle, role changes, data exports, admin actions, soft/hard deletes. Retain ≥1 year**]

After this round, confirm:

```
Compliance:   [framework or "none"]
Data classes: [scheme]
Encryption:   at rest [approach] / in transit [TLS version]
Secrets:      [secrets manager]
Scanning:     [tools]
```

---

## Phase 8 — Domain & Settled Decisions

Defaults (shown in brackets) are based on the reference stack.

Ask:
- What are the key domain concepts or entities in this system? (e.g. "User, Order, Product, Invoice" — a rough list, not a schema) [**No default — this is project-specific**]
- For each entity, what is its data classification? [**Use the scheme from Phase 7**]
- Have any significant architectural decisions already been made? For each: what was decided, and why (brief). These will seed the `## Settled Decisions` table in CLAUDE.md. [**Suggest seeding with the choices already confirmed from Phases 2–7, e.g. "Use PostgreSQL as the primary data store", "OpenTofu over Terraform for licence reasons", "Zero formal compliance framework", "No application-level auth — CORS/WAF as sole access control" (if applicable)**]
- Known edge cases or gotchas? [**Examples to prompt thinking: timezone handling, external API rate limits, pagination of large result sets, partial/in-progress domain objects, idempotency on retried mutations**]

---

## Phase 9 — Jira Integration (optional)

Ask as a single message, making it clear this phase is optional:

> "Does your team use Jira to track work? If so, I can configure the `jira-feature`
> skill so it knows your instance and project keys out of the box.
>
> - **Jira instance URL** — e.g. `https://your-org.atlassian.net`
> - **Default project key(s)** — e.g. `PLAT, API, FE` (the keys you use most often)
> - **Where are acceptance criteria written?** — e.g. a custom field named
>   'Acceptance Criteria', or a `## Acceptance Criteria` heading in the Description
>
> Reply **skip** if your team doesn't use Jira or you'd rather configure this later."

If the user skips, record `jira: none` and move on.

If the user provides details, confirm back:

```
Jira instance:         {url}
Default project keys:  {keys}
AC location:           {custom field name / heading / pattern}
```

Ask: "Does this look right?"

## Output Generation

Once all phases are complete, produce the following two outputs.

**Important:** When the user accepted a default answer, write the **full expanded default
value** into the output — never write "default" or "same as reference stack". The output
must always be a complete, specific, human-readable document.

### Output 1 — CLAUDE.md

Generate a complete, filled-in `CLAUDE.md` using the template structure below.
Fill in every `[fill in]` placeholder with the user's answers.
Use `[TBD]` for anything not yet known.
Include the user's domain concepts in a `## Domain Model` section if they provided entity names.
Include the settled decisions table populated with any decisions from Phase 8.

- Cross-cutting concern (caching, error handling strategy, etc.)
- New cloud resource type, network topology change, or new IAM role/policy with write/admin scope
- New secret, change to backup/retention, or change to the deployment pipeline

When a proposal is accepted, create the corresponding ADR in `docs/decisions/NNNN-title.md`
and update the proposal status to `Accepted`.

See the `architect` and `decision-log` skills for the exact proposal and ADR formats.

## After Output

### Step 1 — Detect local skills

Before telling the user what to do, check whether skills are local to the project:

- Look for `.opencode/skills/` in the project root
- If it exists, list which SKILL.md files are present

### Step 2 — Insert Project Context into local skills

If `.opencode/skills/` exists:

For each SKILL.md found, replace the `## Project Context` placeholder block — the block
that begins with the `> Fill in before use:` blockquote and ends at the `---` rule that
follows it — with the generated Project Context block from Output 2. Do this for every
skill file present.

Confirm to the user which files were updated, e.g.:
> "Updated Project Context in: architect, developer, reviewer, infosec, create-feature"

If `.opencode/skills/` does not exist, tell the user:

> "Skills are not local to this project. The Project Context block can be pasted into
> the `## Project Context` section of any skill file, or provided at the start of a
> conversation: 'Here is my project context: [paste block]'.
>
> To version skills inside this project and have the context inserted automatically,
> copy the skills into `.opencode/skills/` — see the skills README for instructions."

### Step 3 — MCP Setup

Invoke the `mcp-setup` skill to let the user choose which MCP servers to add to
this project. The mcp-setup skill will handle reading/writing `opencode.json` and
explaining each option.

After mcp-setup completes, continue to Step 4.

---

### Step 4 — Finish

Tell the user:

> "Your CLAUDE.md is ready to commit to the root of your repository.
>
> Suggested next steps:
> 1. Commit `CLAUDE.md`, `opencode.json`, and any updated skill files to version control
> 2. Scaffold `infra/modules/`, `infra/envs/{dev,staging,prod}/`, `docs/proposals/`,
>    and `docs/decisions/` directories
> 3. If you have existing architectural decisions, run: `use the decision-log skill to seed the initial ADRs`
> 4. For your first feature, run: `use the create-feature skill`"
