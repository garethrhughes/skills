# Create Feature Skill

This skill describes the complete feature development cycle used in this project. Follow
these steps in order for any non-trivial piece of work. Each step maps to a specific skill.

## Project Context

> Fill in before use: Replace this section with your project's conventions, repository
> locations for proposals and decisions, and any team-specific workflow notes.
>
> Example: "Proposals: docs/proposals/. Decisions: docs/decisions/. Branches: feature/NNNN-short-title.
> PRs target main. CI runs Jest + Vitest + `tofu plan`. Compliance: ISO27001."

---

## Authoritative Rules

Project-wide engineering conventions enforced across every step of this cycle live in
[`RULES.md`](../RULES.md). Each downstream skill (`developer`, `reviewer`, `infosec`)
references the same file. When orchestrating a feature, treat `RULES.md` as the
contract that all output must satisfy.

---

## Feature Intake

Before starting the cycle, gather the feature brief from the user.

Ask the following in a single prompt — do not drip-feed one question at a time:

> "Before we start, I need a brief for this feature:
>
> 1. **Feature description** — What should this feature do? Describe the desired behaviour from the user's or system's perspective.
> 2. **Acceptance criteria** — What conditions must be true for this feature to be considered complete? List them as bullet points if possible (e.g. "Given X, when Y, then Z").
>
> You can be as concise or detailed as you like — I'll use this to drive the proposal in Step 1."

Wait for the user's response. Do not proceed until both a description and at least one acceptance criterion have been provided.

Once received, reflect the brief back in a compact summary table:

```
| Field                | Provided value                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Feature description  | {description}                               |
| Acceptance criteria  | {criterion 1}                               |
|                      | {criterion 2}                               |
|                      | ...                                         |
```

Ask: "Does this capture what you need? Confirm to proceed, or correct anything above."

Wait for confirmation before moving to Step 1.

---

## Feature Document

Once the brief is confirmed, write a feature document to `docs/features/` **before**
invoking the architect skill. This document is the canonical record of what was requested
and why, and it persists independently of the proposal (which describes *how* to implement it).

### File naming

```
docs/features/NNNN-short-kebab-case-title.md
```

Increment NNNN sequentially from the highest existing number in `docs/features/`. Start
at 0001 if no files exist yet.

### Feature document format

```markdown
# NNNN — Feature Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Implemented | Cancelled
**Source:** Manual | Jira:{KEY} | GitHub:{issue-url}
**Related proposal:** docs/proposals/NNNN-short-title.md *(populated after Step 1)*

## Summary

One or two sentences describing what this feature does from the user's or system's
perspective.

## Background / Motivation

Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve or what opportunity does it
capture? Reference any relevant context (user feedback, error rates, product requirement,
linked ticket, etc.).

## Scope

**In scope**
- Bullet list of what this feature covers.

**Out of scope**
- Anything explicitly excluded, to prevent scope creep.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given {context}, when {action}, then {outcome}
- *(one bullet per criterion — specific and testable)*

## Open Questions

List anything that needs answering before or during design. If none, write "None."

## Notes

Any additional context, constraints, or decisions that should inform the architect.
```

After writing the file, confirm to the user:

> "Feature document written to `docs/features/NNNN-short-title.md`. Proceeding to design."

---

## The Full Feature Development Cycle

### Step 1 — Design (Architect skill)

**When:** Before writing any code for a non-trivial change.

Use the **architect** skill to:
1. Determine whether the change warrants a proposal (see the architect skill's "When to Write
   a Proposal" section — note this includes infra-only changes such as new IAM policies,
   network changes, new resources)
2. If yes: write a proposal in `docs/proposals/NNNN-short-title.md`, including the
   **Infrastructure Addendum** if any infra is touched
3. **Present the completed proposal to the user as a structured summary table, then ask for sign-off:**

   ```
   | Section                  | Summary                                      |
   |--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
   | Problem / motivation     | {one-line summary}                           |
   | Proposed solution        | {one-line summary}                           |
   | Acceptance criteria      | {criterion 1}                                |
   |                          | {criterion 2}                                |
   | Key design decisions     | {decision 1}                                 |
   |                          | {decision 2}                                 |
   | Infrastructure changes   | {yes — {summary} / no}                       |
   | Security considerations  | {yes — {summary} / none identified}          |
   | Proposal file            | docs/proposals/NNNN-short-title.md           |
   ```

   Then ask:

   > "Does this proposal meet the brief? Reply **accept** to proceed to implementation,
   > or provide feedback and I'll revise and re-present."

   Do not proceed until the user explicitly accepts. If the user provides feedback, incorporate
   it, update the proposal, update the summary table, and ask again. Repeat until the user accepts.
4. Once accepted: update the proposal status to `Accepted`
5. Update the feature document's **Related proposal** field with the proposal file path
6. Create any ADR(s) that the proposal produces in `docs/decisions/`

**Skip this step only for:** trivial bug fixes, copy changes, or configuration tweaks that
do not affect architecture, module boundaries, schema, infra, or security posture.

**Handoff to Step 2 when:** the user has explicitly accepted the proposal (or the change is
confirmed as trivial).

---

### Step 2 — Implementation (Developer skill)

**When:** Proposal is accepted (or change is confirmed trivial).

Use the **developer** skill to:
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/NNNN-short-title` *(adjust the branch
   naming convention to match your project's standard, or use the convention defined in
   your CLAUDE.md)*
2. Follow the red-green-refactor TDD cycle for every unit of behaviour:
   - Write a failing test first
   - Write the minimum code to make it pass
   - Refactor while keeping tests green
3. Follow all project conventions (thin controllers, typed API client, ConfigService,
   no `any`, no implicit returns, structured logging, validated DTOs)
4. **For infra changes:** edit IaC under `infra/`, run `terraform plan` (or equivalent)
   locally, capture the plan summary for the PR description. Never apply to a shared
   environment from a developer machine
5. Call out any new dependencies (npm packages, Terraform modules, providers) explicitly
   before adding them
6. Run the full test suite before considering the implementation complete

**Handoff to Step 3 when:** all tests pass and the branch is ready for review.

---

### Step 3 — Code Review (Reviewer skill)

**When:** Implementation is complete and tests are green.

Use the **reviewer** skill to:
1. Trace each Acceptance Criterion from the proposal to a covering test
2. Review all staged / branch changes for correctness, security, performance, IaC safety,
   observability, and convention adherence
3. Return a verdict: PASS / PASS WITH COMMENTS / BLOCK

**If BLOCK or Major findings:**
- Return to **Step 2** (developer) to address all Blocker and Major findings
- Re-run the reviewer skill after fixes
- Repeat until the verdict is PASS or PASS WITH COMMENTS

**If PASS or PASS WITH COMMENTS:**
- Acknowledge Minor/Suggestion items (fix or consciously defer)
- Proceed to Step 4

**Handoff to Step 4 when:** reviewer verdict is PASS or PASS WITH COMMENTS with all
Blockers and Majors resolved.

---

### Step 4 — Infosec Sign-Off (Infosec skill)

**When:** Code review has passed AND the change touches any of:

- Authentication, authorisation, or session handling
- User data (read, write, export, deletion)
- Cryptography (encryption, hashing, key management, secrets)
- Logging or audit trails (added, removed, or modified)
- Infrastructure (IAM, network, secrets manager, KMS, public endpoints)
- A new external integration
- A new dependency that handles credentials, crypto, or PII

For pure UI / pure refactor / pure docs changes with none of the above, **skip this step**.

Use the **infosec** skill to:
1. Run the project's compliance review against the diff (e.g. ISO27001 controls if applicable)
2. Verify no plaintext secrets, no over-broad IAM, no PII in logs, no missing auth guards,
   no insecure crypto choices
3. Return a verdict: APPROVED / REQUIRES CHANGES / APPROVED WITH EXCEPTION

**If REQUIRES CHANGES:**
- Return to **Step 2** to fix
- Re-run infosec after fixes
- Document any APPROVED WITH EXCEPTION findings as ADRs in Step 5

**Handoff to Step 5 when:** infosec verdict is APPROVED or APPROVED WITH EXCEPTION
(with exceptions queued for ADR).

---

### Step 5 — Decision Logging (Decision Log skill)

**When:** Implementation is reviewed, infosec-approved, and accepted.

Use the **decision-log** skill to log any significant decisions made during Steps 1–4:
- Technology or library chosen
- Architectural pattern adopted
- Infrastructure topology choice
- Trade-off made between approaches
- Edge case resolution agreed
- Security exception accepted (each one becomes an ADR)
- Proposal accepted (if not already logged in Step 1)

Update any proposals in `docs/proposals/` whose status is still `Draft` or `Under Review`
to `Accepted`, linking the ADR numbers.

**Handoff to Step 6 when:** all relevant ADRs are written and the index is updated.

---

### Step 6 — Pull Request

**When:** Steps 1–5 are complete.

1. Push the branch to remote: `git push -u origin feature/NNNN-short-title`
2. Open a PR targeting `main` (or the project's default branch)
3. In the PR description, include:
   - A summary of what changed and why
   - Link to the feature document (`docs/features/NNNN-short-title.md`)
   - Link to the accepted proposal (if one exists)
   - Link to any new ADRs created
   - Test coverage summary (new tests added, all passing)
   - For infra changes: the `terraform plan` (or equivalent) summary
   - Infosec verdict (APPROVED / APPROVED WITH EXCEPTION + ADR link)
4. Ensure CI passes (including infra `plan` and any IaC tests)

## MCP Tools Available Across the Cycle

The following MCP servers are available to the skills invoked during this workflow. This
section summarises where each is most relevant:

| MCP Server | Most relevant steps | Primary use |
|---|---|---|
| **context7** | Step 1, Step 2 | Look up live framework/provider docs before designing or coding |
| **github** | Step 2, Step 3, Step 6 | Branch/PR operations, CI status checks, diff access for review |
| **filesystem** | Intake, Step 1, Step 2, Step 5 | Read/write feature docs, proposals, ADRs, and source files |
| **semgrep** | Step 2, Step 3, Step 4 | Static analysis — run before handoff at each gate |

Each skill in the cycle is responsible for using these tools appropriately — the guidance
above is a cross-step reference to avoid duplication. See each individual skill for
step-specific instructions.

## Iteration Reference

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Reviewer returns BLOCK | Fix all Blockers → re-review (Step 3 → Step 2 → Step 3) |
| Infosec returns REQUIRES CHANGES | Fix → re-run infosec (Step 4 → Step 2 → Step 4) |
| Implementation reveals design flaw | Write a new proposal or amend the existing one (Step 1) before proceeding |
| New dependency needed | Call it out explicitly in Step 2; reviewer checks supply-chain in Step 3; infosec checks crypto/secrets handling in Step 4 |
| Infra-only change | Same flow — proposal must include Infrastructure Addendum; PR must include `plan` output |
| Trivial fix (no design impact, no infra, no security) | Start at Step 2; skip Steps 1 and 4 |
| Bug fix | Write regression test first (TDD red step), then fix (green), then review |
| Security exception accepted | Must be documented as an ADR in Step 5; reference it in the PR |

## Quick Reference

```
Feature doc → docs/features/NNNN-short-title.md (written before Step 1)
Step 1 → architect skill     (propose; include Infra Addendum if relevant; back-link feature doc)
Step 2 → developer skill     (implement with TDD; capture plan output for infra)
Step 3 → reviewer skill      (code review; loop back to Step 2 if blocked)
Step 4 → infosec skill       (security/compliance sign-off; conditional — see Step 4)
Step 5 → decision-log skill  (log ADRs, update proposal statuses, log any exceptions)
Step 6 → open PR             (include feature doc link, proposal link, ADRs, plan output, infosec verdict)
```
